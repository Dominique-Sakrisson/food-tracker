# food-tracker

### Intent of the app is for the user to easilly track their macro nutrient counts for whatever they've eaten that day

currently there is a shallow selection of foods for testing purposes, and the charts, table values are not linked up for any dynamic interaction
all the interaction with the user is logged to the console. 


## Most recent updated branch is going to be the dev branch
